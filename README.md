## Arena Mayhem

Arena Mayhem Frontend V2. An itiative aimed at enhancing the developer and user experience for one of the top projects in Cartesi’s Rollup Lab. Arena Mayhem serves as a key reference for developers getting started with Cartesi tooling, but the current UI lacks the latest frontend technology and an improved UX. This project proposes a complete overhaul of the frontend to deliver a platform that not only feels like an actual game but also enables developers to fork and bootstrap their projects on top of Cartesi.

## Why Cartesi?

Cartesi’s Rollup technology is integral to the functionality of Arena Mayhem. By leveraging Cartesi, we can provide a highly scalable, developer-friendly environment that simplifies Cartesi Machine integration and fosters seamless project development within the Cartesi ecosystem.

## Scope & Technical Stack

**Frontend:**

- Next.js / TypeScript: For robust and scalable application development.
- TailwindCSS: For efficient and responsive styling.
- Viem / Wagmi: To handle Web3 interactions seamlessly.
- Shadcn UI: A modern React component library for UI development.
- Figma: For creating detailed UI mockups for smooth implementation.

**Backend:**
We will reuse the existing and functional codebase from Joa’s GitHub Repo, connecting its logic to the new frontend.

## Third-Party Integrations

The chosen frontend technologies integrate smoothly with Cartesi, enhancing scalability and facilitating an improved developer experience.
